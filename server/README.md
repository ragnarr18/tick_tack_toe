# General information
The server is written in NodeJS, which must be installed on the machine before running the server code. It can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Also all dependencies must be setup before running the server:
`npm install`

In order to run the server (which will run the server in a watch mode): `npm start`

The server is running on port **8080**

```js
socket.on('game_challenge', gameChallengeObject => {
