In this project we used
- redux
- socket io
- css modules

To run the program:


### Server

  cd ./server/
  
  npm install
  
  npm start

### Client

  cd ./client/
  
  npm install
  
  npm start
	
then open up two browsers on localhost:3000, 
I recommend using Firefox for one and Chrome for the other, so there is no need to go into localstorage and clear out keys!
Or you can just simply open up two tabs on a browser and clear the keys on one tab and refresh.
After that just enjoy!
